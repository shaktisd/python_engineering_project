Stock prediction project based on

Idea is to make a python ML based project using TDD, Traditionally people have been using jupyter notebook.
They good for prototyping , but when it comes to actual project development, a lot of refactoring is required.
Which is an overkill. If we can make reusable components within the project then even prototyping will be faster.
